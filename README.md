# Automated-Cyber-Security-Learning
A simple project that aims at Automating Cyber Security Learning.

This project titled “Automated Cyber Security Learning” as the name suggests aims to “Automate the Learning Path in Cyber Security”. This project consists of 3 Mini-Projects. These 3 Mini-Projects are:
  1. Random Password Generator
  2. News Feeder
  3. CVE List
 
These Mini-Projects would allow an individual to generate and store a password for various websites, receive feeds of information regarding cyber security like latest technologies, vulnerabilities, articles and CVE’s.

This project would automate the task of thinking of a unique and secure password for every website, opening a web browser, typing in a URL and looking for the latest articles. This, hence would not only reduce the wastage of time, but would eliminate the tedious job of looking for materials to study and make learning cyber security more fun.
